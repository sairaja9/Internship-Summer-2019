# Internship-Summer-2019

As an intern at OSU's Department of Computer Science, I worked on two projects relating to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Inclusive Software.

In Dr. Burnett's Lab (the XAI project), I helped conduct a qualitative study that answers the question: what information does a non-AI expert need to evaluate an AI? During this project, I acquired skills relating to study design. I also developed a program that automates the production of AI decision point graphs. These graphs were used to explain an AI's decisions to participants of the study.

In Dr. Sarmaâ€™s lab, I worked on an inclusive software project called Gender Mag. This project aims to improve the user experience (UX) of software across all genders and personalities. By implementing fixes and features, I enhanced a web-based extension tool used to evaluate the UX and inclusivity of websites (https://github.com/sairaja9/GenderMagRecordersAssistant).
